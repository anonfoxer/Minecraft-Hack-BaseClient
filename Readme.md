# slient client
A 1.8.8 ghost utility client based on the open base by OxideWaveLength

# Thank You's
OxideWaveLength for creating the client base and integrating OptiFine
Meteor Client for some of the modules
Salhack for the dry humor inspiration

# What is this?
silent is a Minecraft ghost utility client. Not aimed at Anarchy servers, rather aimed for subtle advantage and use with an internal GUI.
It is made for Minecraft 1.8.8, because thats what practice servers run right?
Its very based, and very backdoored.

# Why?
I want to develop skills in creating utility clients to create a more fully featured one, as well as to increase my knowledge of Java, and have some fun trying to make up my own solutions and modules.

# How to install?
The fuck if I know right now.
